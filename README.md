////Question 1:
///Given the passage in textSample.txt, please remove all words that contain more than
///these letters RSTLN AEIOU and one other letter.
///Then organize the words by length and find the most common word.

////Note the letters RSTLN AEIOU and the additional letter maybe used////multiple times in a word.
///For Example:
///"unclean" uses "N" twice, "LNAEU" are part of "RSTLN AEIOU" and has only one other letter "C", therefore this an acceptable word.
///"households" which contains "HD" has more than one letter outside of our acceptable set so it  must be removed.
///Note the d and h, where "unclean" only uses a c with the assigned set of letters

///Question 2:   Create three sets of random numbers each from 1-1000.

///Output the sets.

///Merge the three sets into a single descending ordered set of numbers without duplicates.

///Output the sets

///Replace any instance of a multiple of 2 with the word "two", any instance of a multiple of 5 with the word "five", and any instance of a number that is both a multiple of 2 and 5 with the word "grapefruit" - Grapefruit should be used ahead of two or five.

///Output the set

///Replace any instance of the word "grapefruit" with 2, and replace any instance of 2 with the word "grapefruit".  For instance ["grapefruit", 2, 1] becomes [2, "grapefruit", 1].

///Output the set

///Please provide your programs and your output from each.
